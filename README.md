CS-105 Group Project for the Gophers: Display US Fire Data on Map

This is a group project designed and implemented by:
Trevor English, Allie Peterson, and Nancy Everest

The purose of this project was to learn about concurrency in Golang by writing an app to display a large amount of fire data on a map using Go, html, Javascript, and Leaflet. Our hope was to see a difference in retrieving and displaying data both serially and concurrently. Though we didn't see a large difference in the load time due to limitations outside of the Go app, we were able to prove a faster processing time using goroutines.
